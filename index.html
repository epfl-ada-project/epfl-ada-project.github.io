          <p class="text-white-50">The demand for road transportation and the rate of motorization have continued to increase in all cities around the world. This increasing demand and the preference for private transport are at the root of many problems, among which road accidents. In fact, the number of accidents has continued to increase, with disastrous consequences.
With our story, we aim to analyze the causes and effects of this phenomenon. We would like to investigate the correlation between the gravity level of a road accident and the components of the traffic system composed of the road, the driver and the vehicule. These components can be described by variables illustrating the drivers behavior, the attributes of the vehicle operated, the quality of the road and the climatic conditions.
<br/>
The dataset we are going to use is extracted from an official <a href="https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/">French open source database platform</a>. The dataset is provided by the <a href="https://www.onisr.securite-routiere.interieur.gouv.fr/en">French road safety observatory (ONISR)</a> and is composed of more than 474,000 accidents from 2005 to 2018. It can be found <a href="https://www.data.gouv.fr/en/datasets/base-de-donnees-accidents-corporels-de-la-circulation/">here</a>.

            <h4>Introduction</h4>
            <p class="text-black-50 mb-0 text-justify">Mrs Alice and Mr Bob are visiting France and are both afraid of being injured while driving. They think that it's unavoidable to have at least one accident in their life but want to minimize their chance to die. We offer to help them by looking at previous years accidents informations that we extracted from a dataset containing all the traffic accidents in France over the last 10 years. In order to do so, we will try to answer the following questions : Is there a way to minimize their chance to die? What are the elements that increase the number of deadly accidents or their severity ? What is the impact of security equipments in accidents death rates ?

          <p class="text-justify">
            Before helping Mrs Alice and Mr Bob, we will start by looking at the latest trends in France. Those can provide useful insights about how the number of accidents have evolved through time.

            Even if the number of accidents on the French roads has remained almost constant between 2013 and 2017, since 2008 it has decreased by 25%. 2018 has been the safest year with only 57,783 accidents. We can also dig deeper and take into account the different months. Indeed the number of accidents vary and depends of the period of the year. 
On the following plot we can observe that some months like October, June or July have a high number of accidents while August and September are safer on average. 


          </p>
          <p class="text-justify">
            Some results were unexpected. In February for example, with the winter, we could have expected more accidents. In August, because of the holiday break and the departures, we could have expected more accidents. 
          </p>
          <p class="text-justify">
            But the number of accident itself is not enough to describe the trends. The gravity is another useful indicator that needs to be taken into account. It is measured as being the level of injury per passenger caused by the accident.
          </p>
          <!-- <Plot of gravity of accidents><Separer les differentes gravite a cause des echelles plus de visibilite des tendances> -->
          <p class="text-justify">
            As we can observe on the above plots, two different trends can be identified. The first one from 2008 to 2013 leads to a sudden drop of in each category. This is due to the decrease of accidents on the same period. The second trend since 2014 shows an increase of unscathed people which is a good point, but the number of injured and slightly injured people went up too. These graphs are influenced by the number of accident, but also by the number of persons involved in accidents.
          </p>
          <!-- plot number of persons per accidents> -->
          <p class="text-justify">
As the upper graph shows, most of the accidents involve less than 4 people. Indeed, most of the time people take the car alone, such as to get to work. As a result, accidents involve few people in average and most of the time, only one vehicle.

              <p class="text-justify">Over the past ten years we recorded 88,218 men involved in accidents for only 41,951 women. This numbers includes both conductors and passengers. Moreover 3,05% of this men died for only 1.89% of the women. Men and women are not equal on the road and don’t face the same risks. This can be linked to the fact that women drive safer and are less reckless behind the wheel.

              <p class="text-justify">The age of a person influences both the probability to be in an accident and to die within. For the men, both probabilities decrease with age. The men and women pyramid shows that the 20-30 years old are the people that are the most prone to be involved in accidents and to die in an accident. For the women the number of death increase after 50 years, which can be due to the vulnerability of people at this age.

              <p class="text-justify">On another hand, looking at the risks of injuries, we notice that even though there are more men exposed to accidents than women, there are less women that end up completely safe compared to men, and there are more risks of injuries as a woman than as a man (62% of chance to be injured as a woman versus 53% as a man).

             We showed previously that the number of accident varies during the year. This may be due to the weather that also impacts the road conditions.

The weather condition with the least percentage of death per accident is during light rainfall. Even with heavy rainfall, this percentage is just above normal conditions. In these conditions, people tend to be more careful.

            <h2>18,7% of killed people in accidents were not wearing a seatbelt.</h2>
            <p class="text-justify"> Besides the security equipments are also different in a car or on a bike and do not protect the same way. Since we already know the security equipments prevent disasters, in this section we want to get an idea of how important they are, quantitatively.</p>
            <p class="text-justify">
              We can also observe different rates of injuries depending on the seat in a car. It is obvious that most collisions in car crashes are frontal. But because of the fact that the middle rear seat often do not have airbags and is exposed to the front window, it is the most deadly place.

                It can be easily shown that the use of security equipment strongly reduce the severity of any injuries. We notice that the seatbelt clearly reduce the number of killed people in accidents, and divides the probability of dying by ten.

          <p class="text-white">
              Using our data analysis, we can draw the perfect portail and setting for Mr Bob and Mrs Alice in order for them to drive safely across France. Mr Bob should be ideally between 20 and 50, and Mrs Alice should be between 30 and 50. Mrs Alice should drive, and Mr Bob should sit in the back seat. Of course, they must both wear their seatbelts. They should be cruising in the middle of France, in the middle of nowhere, avoiding any big city. They should wait to have a perfect weather or at worst a little bit cloudy or rainy.
In this case, looking at last 10 years accidents data in France, they can expect to minimize their chance of dying in an accident !
