          <p class="text-white-50">The demand for road transportation and the rate of motorization have continued to increase in all cities around the world. However, this increase demand and the preference for private transport are at the root of many problems, among which road accidents. In fact, the number of accidents has continued to increase, with disastrous consequences. 
With this project, we aim to analyze the causes and effects of this phenomenon. We would like to investigate the correlation between the gravity level of a road accident and the components of the traffic system composed of the road, the driver and the vehicule. These components can be described by variables illustrating the drivers behavior, the attributes of the vehicle operated, the quality of the road and the climatic conditions. <br/>
The dataset we are going to use is extracted from an official <a href="https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/">French open source database platform</a>. The dataset is provided by the <a href="https://www.onisr.securite-routiere.interieur.gouv.fr/en">French road safety observatory (ONISR)</a> and is composed of more than 474,000 accidents from 2005 to 2018. It can be found <a href="https://www.data.gouv.fr/en/datasets/base-de-donnees-accidents-corporels-de-la-circulation/">here</a>.

            <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">The demand for road transportation and the rate of motorization have continued to increase in all cities around the world. This increase demand and the preference for private transport are at the root of many problems, among which road accidents. 

Mme X and Mr Y are living in France and are both afraid of being injured while driving. They think that it's unavoidable to have at least one accident in their life. We offer to help them by using Data Science. Is there a way to minimize the injuries they may got? What are the elements that augment the number of accidents or increase their severity ? For this purpose we will analyse the french national traffic injuries. 
The dataset used includes all the traffic accidents in France for the past 10 years with details about the passengers, the location or the type of vehicle.

            Even if the number of accidents on the French road has remained almost constant between 2013 and 2017, since 2008 it has decreased by 25%. 2018 has been the safest year with only 57,783 accidents. We can also dig deeper and take into account the different months. Indeed the number of accidents vary and depends of the period of the year. 
            On the following plot we can observe that some months like october, june or july have a high number of accidents while the month of august and september are safer in average. 

          </p>
          <p>
            Some results were unexpected. In February for example, with the winter, we could have expected more accidents. In August because of the holiday break and the departures, we could have expected more accidents. 
          </p>
          <p>
            But the number of accident itself is not enough to describe the trends. The gravity is another useful indicator that needs to be taken into account.
          </p>
          <!-- <Plot of gravity of accidents><Separer les differentes gravite a cause des echelles plus de visibilite des tendances> -->
          <p>
            As we can observe on the above plots two different trends can be identified. The first one from 2008 to 2013 leads to a sudden drop of in each category. This is due to the decrease of accidents on the same period. The second trend since 2014 shows an increase of unscathed people which is a good point, but the number of injured and slightly injured people went up too. This graphics are influenced by the number of accident, but also by the number of persons involved in the accidents.
          </p>
          <!-- plot number of persons per accidents> -->
          <p>
            As the upper graphics shows, most of the accidents involve less than 4 persons. Indeed, most of the time people take the car alone, such as to get to work. As a result, accidents involve few people in average and most of the time only one vehicle.

This numbers includes all conductors and passengers. Moreover 3,05% of this men died for only 1.89% of the women. This can be linked to the fact that women drive safer and are less reckless behind the wheel.

                All accidents are not spread uniformly across the country. Some regions and specific areas have more accidents than others. On the following map, we can observe that the departments with the highest number of accidents are located where big cities are such as Paris and  Marseille. In the middle of the France, where the density of population is lower, fewer accidents happened.

              The first thing to be looked at are the vehicle involved in the accidents. Indeed many parameters depends on it such as the speed before impact and the average injuries of the passengers. Besides the security equipments are also different in a car or on a bike and don’t protect the same way.

                We can also observe different rates of injuries depending on the seat in a car. It is obvious that most collisions in car crashes are frontal. Thus the front seats are most vulnerable.

            <!-- <Plot voiture avec les places et taux de deces> -->

              It can be easily shown that the use of security equipment strongly reduce the severity of any injuries. We will analyse several examples like wearing a seatbelt or a helmet.
